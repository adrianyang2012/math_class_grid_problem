# math_class_grid_problem
In my math class today, the teacher told us what numbers could be a squares area and all its vertices are on the grid/are divisable by 1. So there are square numbers of course, then there are also slanted ones 
We can use the pythogrean theroem to say that a squared + b squared = c squared![220px-Pythagorean svg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69127002/226056076-b9179adf-46c1-427d-9dab-10c83d4fcb16.png)
lets say c squared is the area and then if there are square numbers that add up with another  that one equals c^2 then the square with the area c^2 vertices can be put on the grid and divisable by 1.
