# math_class_grid_problem
In my math class today, the teacher told us what numbers could be a squares area and all its vertices are on the grid. So there are square numbers of course, then there are also slanted ones 
We can use the pythogrean theroem to say that a squared + b squared = c squared![220px-Pythagorean svg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69127002/226056076-b9179adf-46c1-427d-9dab-10c83d4fcb16.png)
lets say c is the area and then if there are square numbers that add up with another one equals c^2 then it can be put on vertices.
